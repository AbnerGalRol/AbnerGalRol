### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

As a recent Business Management graduate turned data enthusiast, I've found my passion lies in transforming raw data into actionable insights. With hands-on experience from a rigorous Data Science Bootcamp, I've honed skills in data inspection, cleaning, and exploratory analysis across 16 diverse projects.

My journey into data science has been exciting. I've delved into crafting SQL queries, building machine learning models, and implementing neural networks, all fueling my fascination with predictive analytics.

Now, I'm focused on advancing my expertise in machine learning, eager to contribute impactful solutions in the ever-evolving data-driven landscape. I'm enthusiastic about applying my skills to tackle challenges and drive innovation while remaining committed to continuous learning and excellence in data-driven decision-making.
